# Birthday-Wish
This project is an animated birthday and New Year greeting experience built with HTML, CSS, and GSAP. It combines smooth timeline-based animations, glowing neon text effects, and responsive layout techniques to create an engaging visual celebration. The year transition animation symbolizes the arrival of a new beginning, followed by a personalized birthday message that fades and slides into view with elegant motion. Custom fonts, text-shadow effects, and color highlights add a festive, modern feel. The project is fully responsive, ensuring proper alignment on all screen sizes, and demonstrates creative use of GSAP for sequencing, transforms, and visual polish.
